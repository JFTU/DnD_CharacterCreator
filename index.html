                <h2>What is Dungeon and Dragons?</h2>
                <p>
                    Dungeons and Dragons is a table-top role playing game where players can explore magical worlds amd go on epic quests!
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two main roles to play within the game, the role of Game Master (GM) also known as the Dungeon Master (DM) and the players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The GM runs the game, describes encounters, plays the non-player characters and playes the enemies. Often GM will create there own world and plot for the game to take place in. However, this is not a requirement and Wizards of the Coast have their own world and lore that adventures can take part in. <a href="">More information can be found here!</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The players each play one character. They have complete control over this character and what they do within the world. Players need to create characters in order to play the game. This website acts as a resource to introduce players to making their first level 1 character.
